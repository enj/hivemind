        Determine the maximum number of concurrent Tasks that can still run.

        This is based on the maximum independent set of the subgraph
        of the transitive closure of the Tasks that are not done.
        See http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/16829

        The maximal_independent_set is based on a random algorithm and thus must
        be run multiple times to have a high chance of getting the max value.

        There is probably a more robust solution that is optimized for partial orders
        and is guaranteed to return the maximum independent set.

        networkx.algorithms.approximation.independent_set has a method called
        maximum_independent_set but it does not seem to work correctly.

        The calculation for sg is highly optimized.  The more straightforward implementation is:
        :code:`sg = transitive_closure(self.dag.subgraph(n for n in self.dag.nodes_iter() if not self.is_done(n))).to_undirected()`

        This will work even without modifying the neighbors method of DiGraph
        and does not require storing of the transitive closure.  However,
        it makes many unnecessary copies of the DAG and thus should be avoided.

        This method is called quite often by the Master, and thus needs to be as
        fast as possible.  Setting a higher MAX_ROUNDS is not recommended.
